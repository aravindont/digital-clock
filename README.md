## HTML

- create `index.html` file inside your folder and give `!` and press `tab` key that gives the basic boiler plate code for the `html` markup

- You will see the first line of html markup as `<!DOCTYPE html>` which tells the browser to load the html markup in the perticular and standard version which is the latest `HTML5` version.

- Install the `live server` extension from the `Extensions` of vscode

## CSS

- First Include the `link` tag inside the `HTML` file so that styles we write in `styles.css` file will be applied to the `tags` in the HTML

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

- I am not using any of the CSS Frameworks those contain the pre-built `styled css classes`. In this project I will be using pure `vanilla css`.
